# Chat App

That app is totally functional we can send messages, add new users, see the recent conversations. To store the messages I use Google firebase, I also use the new API splash Screen to create a splash screen with a few lines of code that does not require an extra activity. It was introduced for API level 31 but I used a dependency it's downwards compatible as well!

A few weeks ago I found an excellent tutorial on you tube made by Chirag Kachhadiya. But is fully in Java, then with a learning purpose, I challenged myself to follow this tutorial and bring everything to Kotlin. Now I am proud of what I did. I'll be going to continue to improve this App. Adding new features.
