# Chat App

That app is totally functional we can send messages, add new users, see the recent conversations. To store the messages I use Google firebase, I also use the new API splash Screen to create a splash screen with a few lines of code that does not require an extra activity. It was introduced for API level 31 but I used a dependency it's downwards compatible as well!

A few weeks ago I found an excellent tutorial on you tube made by Chirag Kachhadiya. But is fully in Java, then with a learning purpose, I challenged myself to follow this tutorial and bring everything to Kotlin. Now I am proud of what I did. I'll be going to continue to improve this App. Adding new features.

I made some improvements in my own chat app now we can edit messages end delete them and send pictures and when we see this picture we can zoom in and zoom out with finger pincers and download these pictures. Was amazing what I can learn through the process. I will continually add new features to this app feel free to give me suggestions and tips or even criticisms.
